# InspoBox
### A heartfelt, novel way to send a message of inspiration that is removed from distractions in everyday life.
#### InspoBox is a iOS companion app to a raspberry pi (credit card sized computer) and lcd configuration 

When you send a text message to someone, they probably have twenty other notifications on their phone. Do they even see your message, is it even special anymore?

Give the raspberry pi and lcd configuration to a loved one, family, friends . All they have to do is plug it in and place it on their desk. (A working wifi connection is also needed)

No matter if you are close by or half a world away, you can send them a message and they will see it on their desk and know you are thinking of them!

Tutorial for the raspberry pi, lcd portion of project will be posted soon!
